Identified a problem with flow direction conditioning not working due to no data values not being robustly handled.

NoData and Type Fixes
11/18/17
A problem occurred in flowdircond due to incorrect recognition of grid no data values.

Implemented the following strategy
-	Store nodata as a double when associated with files and TiffIO because that is how it comes from GDAL
-	Store nodata as partition type when associated with a partition, one of int16_t (short) int32_t (long), float
-	Change short grid storage to int16_t storage because that is how it comes from GDAL (short implementations may be machine dependent)
-	In check for nodata use (double) typecast because nodata is double

With new approach all files need to have no data type properly set in CreateNewPartition
e.g. CreateNewPartition(SHORT_TYPE, totalx, totaly, dxA, dyA, (int16_t)0);
